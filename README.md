# Operator Overloading in C++: Complex Number Example

This C++ program demonstrates the concept of **operator overloading** using a `complex` class to represent and manipulate complex numbers. The program showcases how to overload operators such as `+`, `>>`, and `<<` to perform addition, input, and output operations on complex numbers.


## Objective
-   Adds two complex numbers using the  `+`  operator.
-   Takes input for complex numbers using the  `>>`  operator.
-   Displays complex numbers using the  `<<`  operator.

##  Key Concepts

-   **Operator Overloading**: Customizing the behavior of operators (e.g.,  `+`,  `>>`,  `<<`) for user-defined types (like the  `complex`  class).
-   **Friend Functions**: Using friend functions to access private members of the  `complex`  class for operator overloading.
-   **Object-Oriented Programming**: Encapsulation of data (real and imaginary parts) and operations within the  `complex`  class.

## Why This Project?

This project is a great example for beginners learning about:

 -   Operator overloading in C++.
    
 -   Friend functions and their use cases.
    
 -   Object-oriented programming principles.
